## Sprint highlights
- Goal: deliver a Customer Profile slice end to end
- Done: 7 of 9 stories completed including UI, service, validation, logging
- Metrics: velocity 28, throughput 7, median review time 6 hours, CI pass rate 92 percent
- Next actions: add Blocked column, enable WIP limits, require peer review before merge

## Why Agile here
- Agile fits evolving requirements and the need for fast feedback
- Waterfall would delay learning and increase rework when direction changes

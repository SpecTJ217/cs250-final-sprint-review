# CS 250 Final Project - Sprint Review and Agile Presentation

Portfolio artifact for Southern New Hampshire University CS 250. Role: Scrum Master. This repo contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective document and a short Agile presentation for leadership.

## Deliverables
- Sprint Review and Retrospective (3 to 4 pages, double spaced, Times New Roman 12):  
  `CS250_Final_Project_Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective_Meglen.docx`
- Agile Presentation (6 slides with references):  
  `CS250_Agile_Presentation_Meglen.pptx`
- Evidence image (optional):  
  `CS250_Sprint_Burndown_Meglen.png`

## Sprint highlights
- Goal: deliver a Customer Profile slice end to end
- Done: 7 of 9 stories completed including UI, service, validation, logging
- Metrics: velocity 28, throughput 7, median review time 6 hours, CI pass rate 92 percent
- Next actions: add Blocked column, enable WIP limits, require peer review before merge

## Why Agile here
- Agile fits evolving requirements and the need for fast feedback
- Waterfall would delay learning and increase rework when direction changes

## CS 250 Module Eight Journal

### How I interpret user needs and turn them into a program
Start with the smallest pain the user actually feels. Translate that into a user story with a clear outcome and acceptance criteria so it is testable. I use examples in plain language so the team and stakeholders picture the same result. If the story is too big to demo in one sprint, I split it until we can ship a thin vertical slice. User stories keep me honest because the definition of done is about behavior users can see, not just code written.

### How I approach developing programs and which Agile processes I will use
Small batches, visible work, constant feedback. I keep one ordered backlog, refine stories until they are small and testable, plan a sprint goal, and limit WIP so we finish what we start. I write acceptance criteria early, pair on tricky work, and merge to trunk with peer review and CI running tests on each pull request. I demo a working increment every sprint and use the retrospective to change one or two things in the system of work. That rhythm keeps risk low and progress real.

### What it means to be a good team member in software development
Do what you say, make your work visible, and help unblock others. I keep the board up to date, speak up early on risks, and share context so no task is a single point of failure. I give clear code reviews and accept feedback without drama. I write tests and docs that future me or a teammate can understand. A good teammate improves the teamâ€™s throughput, not just their own ticket count.
